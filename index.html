          <p class="f-card-caption">CMSC Subject</p>
          <p class="f-card-info">
            I have always been into web development ever since HTML and CSS were taught to us in junior high school.
            Tutorials and projects further solidified my interest in the field. This is why CMSC 100 is my favorite CMSC subject;
            it's like the application of what I already know and what I will learn further in the course.

          <p class="f-card-caption">GE Subject</p>
          <p class="f-card-info">
            As someone who isn't artistically inclined, it was surprising that ARTS 1 became my favorite general elective.
            The subject deeped my appreciation for arts and gave me freedom to share my and exchange thoughts with my classmates in the open forums held weekly by our professor.
            Plus, it gave me something interesting to discuss with my friend, who is in the humanities field herself.

          <p class="f-card-caption">Programming Language</p>
          <p class="f-card-info">
            I remember disliking JavaScript when I was first introduced to it in CMSC 12 because it was so different from Python.
            Then I decided to (re)learn the language and was amazed to see how versatile it was.
            I mean, there's still so much left for me to explore about JS, but I'm enjoying what I know so far.

            If I were to pick something to eat everyday for the rest of my life, it would be some good ol' fashioned pork sinigang.
            That's how much I love the food. ðŸ˜‹

              My sister was the one who introduced me to <span>anime</span>.
              I have only started <span>watching</span> them in elementary and <span>reading manga</span> in high school.
              I don't have a preferred genre since my choice of anime or manga depends on my mood. ðŸ˜‚

              If I'm not watching anime or reading manga, you'd find me <span>watching shows or movies</span> instead. 
              I actually prefer sitcoms or crime thrillers, but nowadays I'm leaning towards the horror genre.
